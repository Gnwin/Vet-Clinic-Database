# Vet Clinic Database

A relational database that creates the initial data structure for a vet clinic. A table was created to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

To get a local copy up and running follow this simple steps:

- Clone repository to your local machine: `https://github.com/Gnwin/Vet-Clinic-Database.git`
- Run `git checkout feature/performance-audit`
- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
